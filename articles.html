                        <h3>2020 Holiday Season's Biggest
                            Game Consoles</h3>
                        <h5 class="light grey-text text-lighten-3">It’s
                            blockbuster season for video games.

                            With the holiday season on its way, the games industry is pushing out a diverse lineup of
                            titles,
                            from new installments
                            of long-running franchises like Activision’s Call of Duty and Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed to
                            EA’s
                            long-awaited Star Wars
                            Battlefront II.

                            But the real crowd pleasers this year may be in hardware. Microsoft and Nintendo are
                            offering new or
                            upgraded consoles
                            after Sony rereleased its PlayStation 4 console and more powerful PS4 Pro last year.

                            The hottest hardware ticket is Nintendo’s Switch console, which offers gamers the option of
                            plugging
                            in at home or
                            pulling it off its dock to play on the go. Even though it was released eight months ago, the
                            Switch
                            is still so popular
                            that supply is expected to be a problem at the end of the year.

                            The arrival this week of Microsoft’s new Xbox One X console — featuring more processing
                            power and 4K
                            resolution, which
                            means more defined picture quality — is also expected to make waves. The console supports
                            hundreds
                            of games from the
                            Xbox back catalog, including all Xbox One titles, as well as select Xbox 360 titles.</h5>

                        <h5 class="light-grey-text text-lighten-3">The best gaming console: PlayStation 4 Pro. Who it’s
                            for: Everyone.

                            Why we picked the PlayStation 4 Pro:

                            The PlayStation 4 Pro is the best version of the most popular game platform available today.
                            With
                            4K, HDR 10
                            compatibility, and the PlayStation 4’s exclusive game library, it is currently the best
                            plug-and-play gaming platform.</h5>

                        <h3>Sony PS5 vs. Microsoft Xbox Series X:</h3>
                        <h5 class="purple-text text-darken-3">What are they? Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5
                            are the next-gen games consoles
                            from Microsoft and Sony, which
                            deliver more ambitious and graphically impressive gaming experiences than ever before
                            Xbox Series X and PS5 release date: PS5 releases on November 12 in select regions, and
                            November 19
                            for the rest of the
                            world. The Xbox Series X releases on November 10, 2020
                            What can I play on it? We've seen some big games so far like Marvel's Spider-Man Miles
                            Morales and
                            Halo Infinite (which
                            has been delayed) and more are bound to arrive in the coming years. Both consoles are
                            backwards
                            compatible, though,
                            which means there's plenty to play from the outset
                            Is the PS5 more powerful than Xbox Series X? Their processing capabilities are very similar,
                            but
                            Microsoft has a slight
                            advantage when it comes to sheer processing power
                            What will the PS5 and Xbox Series X cost? The PS5 costs $499 / £449 / AU$795, which is the
                            same
                            price as the Xbox Series
                            X. For sheer value, the Xbox Series S wins out then – but it comes with some caveats. Both
                            it and
                            the digital PS5 lose out
                            on the ability to play 4K Blu-ray discs too. In reality, it seems more than ever then that
                            the
                            choice this time will
                            come down to your loyalty to one console brand or the other – and their services, plus each
                            company's commitment to
                            respecting the library of games you've already built up with them.</h5>
